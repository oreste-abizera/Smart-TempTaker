# Smart-TempTaker
IoT system to collect human body temperatures in a public place and allow alert the health agents for abnormal cases

# What are in this project:
1. Collecting human body temperatures using a temperature sensor in a public place.
2. Displaying on LCD displa the temperature reading.
3. Indicating the person whose temperature is taken whether her/his temperature is normal using a green indicator or abnormal using the red indicator.
4. Alerting the health agents around, using the buzzer, that an abnormal temperature is recorded.
5. Sending records to a web server.
6. Showing a webpage containing the uploaded data.

# Tools used:
- Arduino IDE
- ESP8266 board
- LiquidCrystal_I2C.h library for I2C Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)
- "ESP8266 WeMos D1 Mini" board (referred to as the microcontroller)
